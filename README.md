# Munilol: Public Transit At Its Finest

Every one of the thousands of commuters who pack themselves into the overcrowded Muni public transit system have a crazy story that has to be seen to be believed. Munilol provides a mobile friendly online community that features the most hilarious Muni photos, allowing users to vote on which photos deserve to make it to the front page. Munilol: upload, share, lol.
